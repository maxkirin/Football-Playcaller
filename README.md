# Football-Playcaller

Calling plays in a game of football is a complicated decision that every coach does hundreds of times a game. Is there a way to comprehensively model this decision making? Gathering data from football games, we can begin to build a database of historical data to learn from. Many variables need to be kept track of, such as down and distance, field position, score, time remaining and other factors that go into play calling. We will be creating a ranking system for potential plays and a hierarchy of what is most important when calling a play. From this, we can begin to simulate the best play calls that would (or even should) be made throughout the course of a football game.
